This guide provides instructions for deploying the Prometheus Quick Start into Amazon EKS.

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit, providing a reliable, multi-dimensional time-series data store. Prometheus's main features are:

- a multi-dimensional data model with time series data identified by metric name and key/value pairs
- PromQL, a flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality
- no reliance on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous
- time series collection happens via a pull model over HTTP
- pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration
- multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support

In addition to deploying Prometheus into Amazon EKS this Quick Start also configures monitoring for EKS nodes (`node-exporter`) and the Kubernetes API server (`kube-state-metrics`).


This Quick Start is for developers, devops, security teams, or any role within an organization building, deploying and maintaining applications on Amazon EKS.
